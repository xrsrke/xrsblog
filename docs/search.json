We tend to remember concepts and associations between them and to forget irrelevant details - so, weâ€™ll recall seeing pictures of Jennifer Aniston at the hospital ward, for instance, but wonâ€™t remember details of the specific images.\n\nBiological neurons are multimodal neurons, firing in response to a specific concept regardless of its modality (Quiroga et al., 2005).\nSome neurons even fire for an item related to a specific person (De Falco et al., 2016), or image of the person regarless with their head orinatation (Freiwald et al, 2010).\n\n\nContinual Learning\nFace-selective neurons maintain the same distinctive selectivity patterns for at least 10 years (McMahon et al., 2014).\nCritical Point\n(Stringer et al., 2019) found that the neural representation in the mouseâ€™s visual cortex follows critical points."
